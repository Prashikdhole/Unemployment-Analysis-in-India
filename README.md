# Unemployment-Analysis-in-India

This project centers on the Indian Unemployment Dataset, comprising 754 rows and 7 columns. Our
initial phase involves rigorous data cleaning and wrangling, including column datatype transformations.
Subsequently, we conduct comprehensive EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to extract valuable insights
from the dataset. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis of unemployment rates between the years
2019 and 2020, unveiling trends and patterns within the data
